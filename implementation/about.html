		    <h2>About Walmart</h2>
		    <p>
					Walmart is the most successful retailer in the U.S., with orders of magnitude greater revenue than its nearest competitors. Walmart is also the largest employer in the U.S. with:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2.2 million people employed worldwide</li>
					<li>1.3 million people employed in the U.S. alone</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To train this large workforce, Walmart needed a robust Information System (IS) to keep track of and administer employee training.
				</p>


				<h2>Computer Based Learning</h2>
		    <p>
					The response to this need is the Computer Based Learning (CBL) system. It is a web based interface accessed through Internet Explorer with training content created in Flash.
				</p>
				<p>
					 An employee on occasion receives alerts of new courses and must make time to sit down in front of one of the thin client terminals in the training room in order to complete the course and receive a satisfactory score.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, this system is showing its age and is causing headaches for HR managers throughout the organization.
