		    <h2>Project Schedule Summary</h2>
		    <p>
					The schedule for this project will be broken down into four major sections. The first three will happen in parallel and mostly consist of the planning, analysis, and design phases of the project. Once those have been completed, the final section will encompass the implementation phase and will consist of sub-phases in sequence. They are as follows:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Request for Proposal
						<ul>
							<li>Development (1 month)</li>
							<li>Waiting period (1.5 months)</li>
							<li>Selection period (0.5 months)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Development of course web infrastructure (3 months)</li>
					<li>Development of Installation and Testing protocol for Google Chrome (1 month)</li>
					<li>Multi sub phasic Testing and Deployment Phase
						<ul>
							<li>Alpha Phase: 1 facility, 1 course (test course by developers), 20 employees</li>
							<li>Beta Phase part 1: 2 facilities, 3 production courses, 200 employees</li>
							<li>Beta Phase part 2: 10 facilities, 5 production courses, 1500 employees</li>
							<li>Launch phase: Begin deployment for all facilities through intranet.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Implementation</h2>
		    <p>
					Since the training software is accessible through the intranet for the whole organization, it must be thoroughly tested. A handful of facilities will be chosen to participate in the initial test, during the off-season. A certain number of non-critical training courses that are due for an update will be created in the new format.
				</p>

				<h2>Deployment</h2>
				<p>The project will be deployed in a number of phases. The old system will remain in place throughout the entire deployment process. Since all courses eventually expire and need to be replaced by new ones, all courses will remain until their expiration date, and eventually only courses in the new format will be present. The first three phases will be the launch of pilot courses, used to test the system on experienced users with non-critical courses. After feedback is gathered from those tests, any final adjustments will be made and recommendations sent to the content providers and the final phase, which is the gradual replacement of all courses, will commence.</p>
