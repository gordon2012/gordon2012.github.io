		    <h2>Measurable Organizational Value (MOV)</h2>
		    <p>
					Since employees are required to keep their training up to date and they can only access the system while clocked in, anything that obstructs those activities and keeps them in the training room longer than would otherwise be required is wasted time and wasted money. A more efficient and effective training solution will allow the company to save money by:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Employees not wasting as much time in the training room</li>
					<li>Making better use of available personnel to serve customers better</li>
					<li>Needing less HR personnel to assist employees with training</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Other areas that the project will deliver value to the organization includes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Decreased IT overhead in the form of having to respond to unnecessary tickets</li>
					<li>Lowered cost of development of course content by not having to rely on and purchase licenses for Flash technology</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Resources Required</h2>
				<p>
					There will be a number of resources required, including those that will:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Install the new Chrome browser software</li>
					<li>Maintain the new Chrome browser software with current updates</li>
					<li>Design the web based interface for the courses</li>
					<li>Develop the server infrastructure for the courses</li>
					<li>Create content for the courses</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Existing resources that are currently being used to develop other parts of the company's IS infrastructure may be marshalled for the project's purposes. These include developers that are involved with:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The customer-facing e-commerce website</li>
					<li>The customer-facing mobile app</li>
					<li>The intranet website</li>
					<li>The VPN accessed internet gateway to the intranet</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In addition, a Request For Proposal (RFP) will be developed to requisition content creators, allowing current providers the chance to modify their offerings to meet the requirements.
