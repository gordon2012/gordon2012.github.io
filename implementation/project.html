		    <h2>Problems with CBL</h2>
		    <p>
				There have been many complaints about the aging CBL system caused by Internet Explorer and Microsoft's existing continued support but lack of real functional updates for older versions. This has lead to an increase in the number of tickets being created and results in wasted IT resources that might overwise solve more important problems. Some of these problems include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Internet Explorer crashing</li>
					<li>The thin client crashing</li>
					<li>Course progress not being saved</li>
					<li>Courses not visible that should be</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
				<p>
					The idea for the project originated from a large supercenter in Southern California whose HR manager was frustrated with the CBL system. The stakeholders for this project include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Champion: HR Manager</li>
					<li>Store Manager</li>
					<li>Sponsor: Regional HR Director</li>
				</ul>


				<h2>Project Description</h2>
				<p>
					The project entails the installation of a modern web browser and the creation of new course content created in HTML5. The project will involve:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The replacement of Internet Explorer with Google Chrome</li>
					<li>The replacement of Flash with HTML5 with the possibility of lightweight web frameworks</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Project Scope</h2>
		    <p>
					The scope for this project is limited to the CBL system, but the HR program director has indicated interest in expanding the scope to other projects using similar technologies under the HR umbrella if this project is successful.
